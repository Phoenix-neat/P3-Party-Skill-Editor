The Persona 3 Party Skill Editor is a program with two purposes:

-It can restore any changes made to party member skills by mods or cheats

-It can prepare a save file for use with the New Moon balance patch, by giving party members the skills they should have


The program now features a fully functional GUI that is not only incredibly straightforward, but has instructions on the side.

Instructions:

-Drag Party_Skill_Editor.py into a command prompt window (tested to work with Python 3, should work with Python 2)

-Follow the instructions given by the program

-Drag the created cheat code folder into your cheat code loader of choice (for PCSX2 it's the cheats folder)


The program will then spit out a cheat code document, containing the skills that each party member should have at the level provided in the
game provided for the type provided.

Making your own mods:
You can make your own custom skill progressions (for use with your own mods) by editing Party_Modded.py and Party_Modded_A.py in the "Skill_Progressions" folder.
